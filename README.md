# TV-Network
A program that demonstrates inheritance in java. The show class is the subclass, which inherits the attributes and methods of the TV Network class (superclass)

Show.java is the show class. It includes a constructor that takes in a network, channel, and initial show. It contains a getShow method and a setShow method that get and set the show respectively. This is the subclass.

TVNetwork.java is the TVNetwork class that includes a constructor that takes in an initial network and an initial channel. It also contains methods for getters and setters for channels and networks. This is the superclass.

TVNetworkDriver.java is the driver that initializes a show object. It then displays the attributes of the object, then asks the user to enter new properties for the show object. Lastly, it displays the new properties back to the user.
